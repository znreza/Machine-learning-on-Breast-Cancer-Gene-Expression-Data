# Machine learning on Breast Cancer Gene Expression Data
In this study, the survival status of breast cancer patients is classified in classes like living and deceased based on different combination of surgery and therapies they have received using gene expressions. Classification task is performed with NaiÌˆve Bayes, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. In addition, NPI score of patients is predicted based on different combination of surgery and therapies as well as five breast cancer subtypes. Regression task is performed with Random Forest Regressor, Support Vector Regressor (SVR) and Kernel Ridge Regressor (KRR). Different feature selection models are also used including mRMR and Regularized Linear Model. The performance of the models is evaluated based on ROC analysis obtained from 10-fold cross-validation and model selection procedure. According to final observation, the model with ElasticNet Regularized Linear Mode combined with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) provides the highest accuracy with the lowest number of features when classified with RBF SVM. For regression task, KRR predicts the NPI score most accurately with the lowest number of predictors.
